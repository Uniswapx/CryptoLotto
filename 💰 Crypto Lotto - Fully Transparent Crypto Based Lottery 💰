# 📌 Rule
I will obey the rules below to make this project **TRANSPARENT**
1. All users can check every participants bet amount
2. All users can check how much fee is paid to me
3. I will **NEVER** join the lotto so as to maximize the fairness
4. Fee will be **NO MORE THAN** 5%  
(It means max 5%, actual fee will be very likely to be much lower than this)

# Motivation
Hello  
I am highly skilled crypto developer  
who manages multiple crypto based project.  

I am happy to introduce my another public project,  
the Crypto Lotto, the Pure Crypto based Lotto.  

I have seen many lotto in this crypto world.  
But they all made most of the thing as **HIDDEN**.  
They may announce some informations.  
But users **CANNOT VERIFY IMPORTANT THINGS** related with the lotto.  
How much actually is the money got in by the users,  
How much actually is the money being used by the project team, etc.  

So I decided to make a **TRANSPARENT** lotto system.  
Which is possible by using the blockchain.  

To gather willing participants + get more motivation for this,  
I am shilling this group before full preparation.  
I will focus on developing and completing this project to be live,  
also making decisions of payment, rate, mininum bet, etc.  

If you have any suggestions,
write down in the group freely.

Thx :)
